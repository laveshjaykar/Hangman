How to Play

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Navigate to the cloned repository's directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Run the game with the command python hangman.py.
The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters of the chosen word. Guess a letter by typing it and pressing enter.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s). If not, you'll lose a life.
